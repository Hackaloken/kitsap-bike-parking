# kitsap-bike-parking

Together, we will build a crowdsourced map of bike parking in Kitsap County.

For now, just use this repository. 

Add any location of bike parking in Kitsap County as a pull request edit to this README or as an issue. 

You should be adding:
(1) The location: this is a complete address or Lat/Long coordinates
(2) a description of the bike parking - size/covered/etc.
(3) a picture (optional)

There is now a CSV! Fill it in

 - NAME - something unique
 - ADDRESS - the address please
 - DESC - what you think when you look at it
 - VARIANT - STAPLE, WAVE, BOLLARD, GRID, DOUBLE
 - SPACES - how many bikes
 - COVERED - is it protected from rain?
 - LNG - if you know the longitude (else, I will get it from address)
 - LAT - if you know the latitude (else, I will get it from address)
