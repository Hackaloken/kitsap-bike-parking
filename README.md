# kitsap-bike-parking

Together, we will build a crowdsourced map of bike parking in Kitsap County.

For now, just use this repository. 

Add any location of bike parking in Kitsap County as a pull request edit to this README or as an issue. 

You should be adding:
(1) The location: this is a complete address or Lat/Long coordinates
(2) a description of the bike parking - size/covered/etc.
(3) a picture (optional)

There is now a CSV! Fill it in
